# Getting started with iTwin Platform

## What is iTwin Platform?

iTwin Platfrom is a collection of APIs and services designed to help you build digital twin applications

## What are we going to use iTwin Platform

We are going to use a 3d viewer called [iTwin Viewer](https://github.com/itwin/viewer) built using [iTwin.js](https://github.com/iTwin/itwinjs-core).  Both of these are open source APIs provided for free.  The iTwin Viewer uses [iTwin Platform services](https://developer.bentley.com/) to serve out the 3d model and other 3d assets.  These are paid services with a free trial that we will use.

## Sign up

Go to https://developer.bentley.com/, click on the 'Free Trial' button and create an account.
Share the email that you used for the account so we can add you to the project.

## View the Model

Once you have signed up and been added to the project go to https://itwin.bentley.com/

Select 'PhiladelphiaModel' Project then select the 'Philadelphia' iModel.

This will take you to the 3d view of the iModel showing a map of Philadelphia with a grid plan of the city.  You can turn on a 3d model of the city create using photogrammetry and a one from OpenStreet Maps
